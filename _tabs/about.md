## Paul Cushing?

I often take notes on the things I learn. New shortcuts. The syntax for this or that. However, I also have not found 1 place to log all of the notes. Many of them have been in physical notebooks that are now long gone... along with the information. Many have been in Apple Notes, Evernote, Notion, or one of the many other wonderful note taking apps I've used. 

This will hopefully be the solution. One note repository to rule them all. We shall see.
