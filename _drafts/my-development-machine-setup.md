It happens every couple of years. The company gives me a shiny new Mac. Or I'm fortunate to get a new one for myself, and I get to begin again. I know there are ways to "transfer" many of my settings from machine to machine, but I love a fresh start.

There are a handful of things I use all the time and have no problem remembering how to install and configure them, and there are a bunch that are more rare and I have to learn it all over again. With that in mind, I thought it'd be a great idea to record what I like to install on my fresh sotware development computer.
